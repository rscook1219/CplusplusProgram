DSA Analysis and design
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

- The goal of these projects was to create a program that will allow academic advisors to keep track of courses and prerequisites for said courses. It also allows them to keep track of the prerequisites that students have done so that the advisor is aware if they have completed the needed prerequisites for the next class the student wants to take. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

-I had to determine what data structure I would use to store the course information needed before writing any code. I needed to consider the efficiency of each data structure before I came to the conclusion that a hash table would be the best to use.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

-I ran into a few challenges while working on the project. I often used the notes I had taken while going through the coursework, online forums (StackOverflow, Quora, etc.), and YouTube to overcome the challenges I came across. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

-I had very little experience with working with the data structures that were covered in this course. However, the coursework I feel I have a solid understanding of the data structures as well as the runtime efficency of each.  

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

-Woirking through this project has helped me understand how strong object-oriented programming is. I think that using and creating classes help keep code DRY and allows other developers to easily create new instances of classes instead of writing more excessive code.
